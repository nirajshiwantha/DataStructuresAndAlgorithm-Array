Array Operations and Algorithms

Welcome to the Array Operations and Algorithms repository! I have created this repository to share code examples and explanations for various array operations and algorithms commonly used in computer science. Whether you are a student, a developer, or just an enthusiast who wants to improve your algorithmic skills, I hope this repository can be a helpful resource for you.

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. They are used to store collections of values of the same type, and can be manipulated and processed in various ways. This repository covers a range of topics related to array operations and algorithms, including:

Array manipulation: inserting, deleting, and updating elements in an array, reversing an array, shuffling an array, and more.
Sorting and searching algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, binary search, linear search, and more.
Dynamic programming: solving problems using dynamic programming techniques, such as the longest increasing subsequence problem and the 0-1 knapsack problem.
Other array-related algorithms: computing the median of two sorted arrays, finding the majority element in an array, and more.
Each code example comes with detailed comments and explanations to help you understand how the algorithm or operation works. The examples are written in C#, a popular programming language used in the .NET framework, but the concepts can be applied to other languages as well.

I hope that you find this repository helpful in your studies, projects, or job search. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
